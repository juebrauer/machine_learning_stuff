# Machine Learning Stuff

Collection of stuff that has to do with machine learning

# AI documentaries

- [YouTube 1h28min: Schlaue neue Welt - Das KI-Wettrennen | Doku HD | ARTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJsa6wZ6ovY)<br>
  Interesting documentary from ARTE about the race for AI. Especially interesting for the insights into the German company "Aleph Alpha".




# LLMs

- [YouTube 17min: Ollama + Phi3 + Python - run large language models locally like a pro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE0KAAuCb60)<br>
  Shows how to get the Phi3 LLM running using ollama

- [YouTube 13min: What's next for AI agentic workflows ft. Andrew Ng of AI Fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc)<br>
  Andrew Ng talks about the next big step in LLM research: agents that solve complete problems step by step. There are also very good paper links to recent work on this on Andrew's slides!
  
- [YouTube 9min: Create Phi-3 Chatbot with 20 lines of code (runs without wifi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzEVK8p3VM)<br>

  One of the introduction videos OpenAI posted when they introducted GPT-4o on May 13, 2024 that can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time. See their related article ["Hello, GPT-4o"](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)


# Transformers

- [YouTube 40min: Deep dive - Better Attention layers for Transformer models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TT384U4vQg) - explains attention mechanism variants like Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Group-Query Attention (GQA), Sliding Window Attention (SWA), Flash Attention, Flash Attention v2,Paged Attention
39:00 The Hugging Face LLM performance leaderboard
- [YouTube 27min: But what is a GPT? Visual intro to transformers | Chapter 5, Deep Learning](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=w2919EbAb6KFWxx8)<br>

- [YouTube 26min: Attention in transformers, visually explained | Chapter 6, Deep Learning](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=shGK_5l0TCvClWas)<br>
  Gives you a good intuition what the attention mechanism in Transformers does. There are also nice other videos by [3Blue1Brown/Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) who wrote his own [animation engine for explanatory math videos](https://www.3blue1brown.com/about).
